# üöó Salifort Motors - HR Employee Turnover Prediction

## üìä Project Overview

This project explores employee turnover at **Salifort Motors**, a multinational vehicle manufacturing company. High turnover is a growing concern, both culturally and financially. This analysis aims to:
- Identify key factors contributing to employee departure
- Build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of an employee leaving
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce turnover and improve employee retention

The dataset used in this project (`HR_capstone_dataset.csv`) includes 14,999 employees and 10 self-reported features related to job satisfaction, evaluation, workload, and employment status.

## üß† Goals

- Analyze the factors leading to employee turnover
- Build and compare predictive models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Interpret model outputs and feature importance
- Recommend data-driven solutions to improve retention and employee satisfaction
